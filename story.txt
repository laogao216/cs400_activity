Robert takes a walk in a forest in the fall. The leaves has turned yellow and fill the atmosphere with melancholy. Soon the path he's on diverged into two and Robert has serious decision issues. One of the paths is well worn while the other is grassy. Which path should Robert take? What would he find on the path he takes?

Middle by Weihao Xu: Robert look down the worn road as far as he can,to where it bend in the undergrowth. But he chooses the other one, which is full of grasses and mysteries that few travelers have stepped into. Leaves have fallen on his hat, and his boots are covered with the mud. But he found that he is not alone. There is also a girl on the side of the road, picking up the wild flowers into her basket.
